# About
## Objective
In the modern world, effective task management is crucial for productivity. This project aims to develop a web application that enables users to efficiently manage their tasks using a Todo List. By utilizing EJS (Embedded JavaScript) and MongoDB, the application will offer a dynamic and interactive user experience, allowing for seamless task management. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, with all data stored permanently in a MongoDB database.
## Technology Stack
### EJS (Embedded JavaScript):
EJS will be used to create dynamic HTML templates. It allows the embedding of JavaScript code within HTML, enabling real-time page updates and a smooth user interface.
### MongoDB:
A NoSQL database that will store all task-related data. MongoDB is chosen for its flexibility and ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently.
### Node.js:
The server-side environment in which the application will run. Node.js is known for its scalability and performance.
### Express.js:
A web application framework for Node.js, it will facilitate the creation of a robust backend to handle user requests and interact with the MongoDB database.
## Project Requirements
## User Interface
### Task Creation:
Users can add new tasks to their Todo List. The form for adding tasks will be user-friendly and intuitive. (Task not create until if task title is empty.)
### Task Editing:
Users can modify existing tasks. This feature will allow changes to the task's  or priority. Use a Pencil icon for showing Edit button.
Task Deletion: Unnecessary tasks can be removed. Users can delete tasks individually to maintain an organized list. Use a Trash icon for showing Delete button.
## Backend Functionality
### Data Storage:
All tasks will be stored in a MongoDB Altas database, ensuring data persistence and reliability.
### Dynamic Updates:
By using EJS templates, the application will dynamically update the user interface as tasks are added, edited, or deleted.
## Database Structure
The MongoDB database will have a collection named tasks, with each document containing:
title: Title of the task
priority: set the task complete is urgent, low and high like this.
